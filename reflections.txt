These are my reflections about GIT.

How do you feel about Git?
I think it's interesting and simple. According to everyone in the know, it's a much better
solution than previous source control solutions.

Some more Thoughts?
I wish the course went a little more depth on the ssh options of github. I need to learn more
about ssh on my own anyway.
