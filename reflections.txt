These are my reflections about GIT.

How do you feel about Git?
I think it's interesting and simple. According to everyone in the know, it's a much better
solution than previous source control solutions.

Some more Thoughts?
I wish the course went a little more depth on the ssh options of github. I need to learn more
about ssh on my own anyway.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You'd want this because every time git updated, you'd have to deal with merge requests between
your code and the updated code pushed to the repo by someone else.

Benefit of having a copy of the last known state of remote locally?
the benefit is that you can merge any change and know the state of the repo while offline.
